## 1.	Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to check how much each stockâ€™s return was over one year of price changes. So, for each year, in the end, each stock either had a positive or negative return rate, and this would indicate how well it did over the course of the year and whether it would be worth investing in in the future.
